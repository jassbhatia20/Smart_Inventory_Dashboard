#  Warehouse Inventory Manager (CLI v1.0)

###  Welcome!
This is a robust **Command Line Interface (CLI)** tool designed to help retail owners manage their stock. 
It is built entirely in Python and demonstrates the power of **Data Structures** (Lists and Dictionaries) to handle complex data in real-time.

> **Note:** This is Version 1.0. It runs in the console and stores data in memory (RAM). Data is reset when the application closes.

##  Key Features
* **Smart Validation:** The system prevents you from creating duplicate Product IDs or Names.
* **Flexible Stock Management:** You can easily **Add** new stock or **Sell** existing stock (updating quantities instantly).
* **Search Engine:** Find any product details instantly by typing its name.
* **Formatted View:** Displays your inventory in a clean, aligned table.
* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete products seamlessly.

---

##  The Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Concepts:**
    * **List of Dictionaries:** Used to structure complex product data.
    * **Error Handling:** `try-except` blocks ensure the app never crashes on invalid input.
    * **Control Flow:** Uses `while` loops and menu-driven logic for a smooth user experience.

##  Future Roadmap
I am actively working on the next versions:
* [ ] **v2.0 (Persistence):** Adding JSON storage so data is saved forever.
* [ ] **v3.0 (Web UI):** Upgrading to a **Streamlit** dashboard for browser access.
